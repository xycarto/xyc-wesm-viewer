# XYCarto WESM Data Viewer

**SITE LINK:  https://xycarto.github.io/xyc-wesm-viewer/**

Proof of Concept (POC) site developed to demonstrate USGS 3DEP LiDAR point cloud processing from https://github.com/xycarto/wesm-surfaces.

- The website utilizes access to surfaces in COG formats, plus access to vector tiles for WESM grids and point cloud density files.

- This is a rudimentary website only for demsonstration purposes of COG interaction, plus dmeonstrations of the surfaces created.

- The site is subject to change without notices

- The site provides links to the COG surfaces used on the site. These COGs are provided only in ESPG:3857. Future development for COGs in native projection is still to come.

- S3 links to COGs may also be used in QGIS

**IMPORTANT**

This site is in no way affiliated with any government entitiy and is purely for demonstration purposes only.
